      <h1>Cities</h1>
      <p>Italy is home to some of the most iconic cities in the world. You've got Rome, the Eternal City, steeped in history and architecture like the Colosseum and Pantheon. Then there's Florence, the birthplace of the Renaissance, where art and culture flow through the streets like the Arno River. Venice, the City of Water, is a maze of canals and romance. From Milan's high-end fashion to Naples' pizza and coastal charm, Italy's cities each have their own vibe. Bologna's medieval architecture and food scene are often overlooked but totally worth a visit. And let's not forget cities like Turin, with its royal heritage, or Palermo, rich in Sicilian culture. Italy's got a city for every kind of traveler.</p>
